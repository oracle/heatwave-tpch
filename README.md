# HeatWave TPC-H

HeatWave is a fully managed and highly scalable in-memory database service which provides a cost-efficient solution for
SQL analytic processing. It is tightly integrated with MySQL database and is optimized for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

You can run analytics on Your MySQL data without requiring ETL and without any change to Your applications. Your
applications connect to the HeatWave cluster through standard MySQL protocols, and you can manage HeatWave
via Oracle Cloud REST APIs, SDKs, and the Console.

This repository contains SQL scripts derived from [TPC Benchmark&trade;H (TPC-H)][1]. The SQL scripts contain TPC-H schema
generation statements and queries derived from TPC-H benchmark, specific for MySQL Database Service and
HeatWave.

## Software prerequisites:
1. [TPC-H data generation tool][2] to generate TPC-H dataset for workload sizes of your choice
2. [MySQL Shell][3] to import generated TPC-H dataset to MySQL Database Service

## Required services:
1. [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][8]
2. [MySQL Database Service][4] and [HeatWave][5]

## Repository
* [TPCH](TPCH) - a collection of scripts for TPC-H schema and queries specific to MySQL Database Service
* [HeatWave](HeatWave) - a collection of scripts to configure HeatWave to run TPC-H queries

## Getting started
To run TPC-H queries in HeatWave
1. [Generate TPC-H data using TPC-H data generation tool](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/heatwave-tpch-sample-data.html)
2. Provision MySQL Database Service instance. See [Getting Started with MySQL Database Service][6]
3. Run [create_tables.sql](TPCH/create_tables.sql) to create TPC-H schema on MySQL Database Service instance
4. Import TPC-H data generated to MySQL Database Service instance. See [MySQL Shell Parallel Table Import Utility documentation][7]
5. Add a HeatWave cluster to MySQL Database Service instance. See [HeatWave][5] documentation
6. Run [secondary_load.sql](HeatWave/secondary_load.sql) to configure and load data to HeatWave cluster
7. You are now ready to run the queries derived from TPC-H
